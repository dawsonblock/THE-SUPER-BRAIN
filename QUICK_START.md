# Brain-AI v4.0 - Quick Start Guide

**⚡ Get Started in 5 Minutes**

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended for Development)

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter directory
cd C-AI-BRAIN-2

# 2. Run the development startup script
./start_dev.sh

# 3. Access the system
# GUI:      http://localhost:3000
# REST API: http://localhost:5001
# Metrics:  http://localhost:5001/metrics
```

The `start_dev.sh` script will:
- Build C++ core with Python bindings
- Start REST API with hot reload (SAFE_MODE=1, no real API calls)
- Start GUI dev server with hot reload
- Create all necessary data directories

**Stop services:**
```bash
./stop_dev.sh  # or Ctrl+C in the terminal
```

### Option 2: Docker Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (or use defaults for testing)

# 2. Start all services
docker compose up --build

# 3. Access the system
# GUI:      http://localhost:3000
# REST API: http://localhost:5001
# Metrics:  http://localhost:5001/metrics

# 4. Stop services
docker compose down
```

### Option 3: Production Deployment (Local)

```bash
# 1. Set up production environment
cp env.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with your production API keys

# 2. Run production startup script
./start_production.sh
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
# C++ tests
cd brain-ai/build
ctest --output-on-failure

# End-to-end integration test
./test_e2e_full.sh
```

### Run Individual Components
```bash
# C++ core only
cd brain-ai && ./build.sh

# REST API only
cd brain-ai-rest-service
uvicorn app:app --reload

# GUI only
cd brain-ai-gui
npm run dev
```
