### **Narration Script**

```
"Hi! This is Brain-AI v4.5.0, a production-ready RAG++ system.

[Show interface]
Here's the modern React interface with real-time stats.

[Fast Mode demo]
Let me ask a simple question in Fast Mode... 
See how quick that was? Under a second!

[Click Deep Think]
Now let me enable Deep Think mode for complex questions...

[Ask complex question]
Watch this - it's using multiple AI agents working together...
And there's the verified answer with higher confidence!

[Show settings]
You can customize everything in the settings panel.

[Cache demo]
And check this out - asking the same question again...
Instant! That's the fuzzy cache in action - 31 times faster!
